# Welcome to My Markdown File

## Introduction

This is a sample Markdown file to demonstrate various formatting options.

### Text Formatting

You can make text **bold**, *italic*, or ***both***. You can also use ~~strikethrough~~ for deleted text.

### Lists

Here's an unordered list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Links and Images

You can add [links](https://www.example.com) and ![images](https://via.placeholder.com/150).

### Code

Inline `code` looks like this.

For code blocks, use triple backticks:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

### Horizontal Rule

## Conclusion

This is just a basic example. Markdown offers many more formatting options!
